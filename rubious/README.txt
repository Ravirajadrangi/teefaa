# teefaa/rubious - is an attempt for object-oriented scripting in Ruby
# 
# This section is a similar attempt as teefaa/pithonize. But the biggest motivation
# in rubious coding of teefaa is Chef's growth. Developing teefaa in ruby would hopefully
# allow friendlily to plug Chef in and reduce lines to develop.
