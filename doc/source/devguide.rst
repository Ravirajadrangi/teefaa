Developers Guide
================

Teefaa is part of cloudmesh. If you like to contribute, please get in contact with Koji Tanaka (kotanaka@indiana.edu)
and Gregor von Laszewski (laszewski@gmail.com).

We are following the usual python development standards.

Teefaa is integrated in a larger project that provides a convenient 
mechnism to interface with several IaaS frameworks and is going to 
provide a User interface to teefaa functionality as part of cloudmesh.

Code
------

The main code of teefaa is maintained in the "master" branch. Oher branches are internal 
development branches and can be ignored.

Documentation
--------------

The documentation of Teefaa is maintained as gh-pages. To achive this it is important that you 
first create a documentation without errors. This is done by calling::

  make html 

in the main directory. YOu can inspect the result by opening a browser at::

  doc/build/html/index.html
  
If all loooks good. make sure you have committed **ALL** changes. Than call simply::

  make gh-pages
  
If everything went well you will be back in the master branch. 
If for some reason there is an error, you may be in the gh-pages branch. 
Make sure to switch back to master and fix your errors there. However if you have
a working local version this will probably not happen.
