Cloudmesh Teefaa is a set of deployment scripts for System Provisioning with 
focus on  baremetal provisioning. It is designed to be simple, flexible, programable. 

Requirements
------------

FG Teefaa requires:

* Python, version 2.7
* Python Modules

  - Fabric, version 1.6
  - Cuisine, version 0.6
  - PyYAML, version 3.10

* Squashfs-tools (for creating snapshots of Operating System)
* Bittorrent Sync (for high-speed multiple Baremetal Provisioning)
* Torque Resource Manager (for scheduing Baremetal Provisioning)


Simple Design
-------------

* Scripts for handling Shell commands are written in Fabric and Cuisine.
* Configuration files are written in YAML format. One of the goals of Teefaa 
  is to make it understandable by reading the YAML files.
* Each scripts has four types of directories as shown below. ::

    |-- fabfile/EXAMPLE.py
    |-- ymlfile/EXAMPLE
    |           |-- config1.yml
    |           `-- config2.yml
    |-- private/EXAMPLE
    |           `-- dir1
    |               |-- file1
    |               `-- file2
    `-- share/EXAMPLE
              `-- dir1
                  |-- file1
                  `-- file2

This stracture enables a simplified separation among concurrent developments, which allows 
people to work on multile projects and multiple versions in a simple fashion. For example, 
while one person is developing EXAMPLE, another person can start developing EXAMPLE2.
