Welcome to the teefaa documentation
=========================================
FutureGrid Teefaa Toolbox is a set of documented scripts which helps for 
making snapshots of multiple Linux Distributions and provisioning them on 
Bare-Metal machines. The goal is to provide the scripts and methods to build 
a different type of cluster which provides the way for cluster users to run 
their own unique os images on bare-metal nodes. 

Get Started
------------
We installed the beta version on india so that FutureGrid users can use it soon.
