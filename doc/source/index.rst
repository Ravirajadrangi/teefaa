FutureGrid Teefaa is a set of scripts for Baremetal Provisioning. Which is designed as simple, 
flexible, programable, collaboratable so that we can build, test and appreciate new Open Source 
Technologies.

Teefaa Requires(/Thanks to):

* Python, version 2.7
* Python Modules

  - Fabric, version 1.6
  - Cuisine, version 0.6
  - PyYAML, version 3.10

* Bittorrent Sync (for high-speed multiple baremetal provisioning)
* Torque Resource Manager (for scheduing baremetal provisioning)

The goal of FG Teefaa is to provide the scripts and methods to easily provision multiple 
Operation Systems on Baremetal hosts on multiple sites.
