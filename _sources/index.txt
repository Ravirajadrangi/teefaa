Welcome to the teefaa documentation
=========================================
FutureGrid Teefaa Toolbox is a set of documented scripts which consists of Snapshot,
Clouimg, Bootstrap and Torque Plugin.

* Snapshot - Makes a snapshot of your system and compresses it.
* Cloudimg - Makes a cloud image from a snapshot.
* Bootstrap - Installs a system from a snapshot, a running system or a running instance.
* Torque Plugin - Provides cluster users to provision OS images on compute nodes.

The goal of FG Teefaa is to provide the scripts and methods to easily provision multiple 
systems at user's local enviromnent(Desktop, Laptop, VMs), at Cloud as instances and at 
Bare-metal Cluster as bare-metal hosts.
